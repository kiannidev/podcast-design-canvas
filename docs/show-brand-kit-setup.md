# Show Brand Kit Setup

Brand setup should help each podcast feel distinct without forcing creators to design every visual element from scratch.

## User Goal

A creator should be able to add show branding once, preview how it affects presets and canvas layouts, and reuse it across future episodes.

## Brand Inputs

The setup should support:

- logo
- show colors
- type style preference
- lower-third style
- caption emphasis level
- background texture or image
- sponsor placement rules
- thumbnail or cover treatment

Inputs should remain optional. A creator should be able to start from strong defaults and refine the brand kit over time.

## Preview Surfaces

Brand choices should preview in the places they actually appear:

- preset cards
- speaker frames
- captions
- title moments
- lower-thirds
- b-roll callouts
- export thumbnail

The preview should use real episode speakers when available, not generic placeholder content.

## Guardrails

Branding should not reduce viewer clarity:

- captions stay readable
- speaker faces remain unobstructed
- sponsor marks do not crowd lower-thirds
- color contrast works for long-form viewing
- layouts still adapt to different speaker counts

When a brand choice creates a readability problem, the product should suggest a fix rather than silently rejecting it.

Brand conflicts that would affect the chosen export destination should surface in `docs/export-readiness-review.md` Thumbnail Warnings.

## Reuse

A brand kit should attach to a show template but remain editable. Teams should be able to update future episodes without changing already exported episodes.

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that makes show identity reusable across presets, canvas edits, and exports. Close work that creates a single house style for every podcast or makes brand setup mandatory before creators can preview an episode.
