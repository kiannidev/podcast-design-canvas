# Destination Crop Previews

Destination crop previews should show creators how the same episode design will look across publishing surfaces before export.

## User Goal

A creator should be able to check whether speakers, captions, logos, thumbnails, and sponsor elements still work when the episode is prepared for different destinations.

## Preview Surfaces

Support previews for:

- wide full episode
- mobile vertical crop
- square social preview
- thumbnail or cover frame
- client review copy
- archive master

The default export path can still prioritize long-form video, but the creator should see when another surface would crop or hide important content.

## Checks

Flag visible issues:

- active speaker is cropped
- captions fall outside safe area
- logo is cut off
- lower-third is unreadable
- sponsor mark conflicts with crop
- title text is too small in thumbnail view

Each issue should link to the affected preview surface and moment.

Destination crop issues that would affect the chosen export destination should surface in `docs/export-readiness-review.md` Readability Warnings and Speaker Framing Warnings.

## Fixes

Offer direct fixes:

- use alternate crop
- move captions for this destination
- simplify thumbnail text
- use safer logo position
- switch layout for cropped output
- export only the long-form master

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that helps creators trust destination-specific framing before export. Close work that treats every destination as identical or prioritizes short-form crops over the core long-form episode.
