# Audio And Caption Quality Review

Audio cleanup and captions should feel like one creator-facing quality pass, not two separate technical tools.

## User Goal

A creator should be able to make speech clearer, keep speaker volume balanced, and trust the captions before publishing a long-form episode.

## Relationship To Export Flow

Audio and caption quality review should summarize open issues from work already captured in the workspace:

- speaker sync and ingest context from episode ingest
- speaker attribution from `docs/speaker-attribution-review.md`
- caption style from `docs/preset-style-picker.md`
- brand emphasis from `docs/show-brand-kit-setup.md`
- safe area placement from `docs/layout-safe-areas.md`
- readability checks from `docs/accessibility-readability-checks.md`
- conversation cleanup from `docs/pause-crosstalk-cleanup.md`
- glossary spellings from `docs/transcript-glossary.md`
- social context from `docs/social-context-intake.md`

Caption style conflicts that would affect the chosen export destination should surface in `docs/export-readiness-review.md` Readability Warnings. Speech clarity, loudness balance, and conversation cleanup issues should surface in `docs/export-readiness-review.md` Audio Cleanup Warnings. Low-confidence proper nouns and spelling gaps should surface in `docs/export-readiness-review.md` Glossary Warnings.

## Audio Controls

Use plain-language quality controls:

- reduce room noise
- balance speaker volume
- improve speech clarity
- soften harsh audio
- keep natural voice tone

Each control should preview the result on the current speaker and preserve a simple reset path. Avoid exposing compressor ratios, gates, bitrates, or filter chains in the default workflow.

## Caption Confidence

Caption review should focus attention where corrections matter most:

- low-confidence proper nouns
- names, companies, products, and show-specific phrases
- missing words during cross-talk
- captions that collide with lower-thirds or b-roll
- long lines that become hard to read

Corrections should apply across repeated terms when the creator confirms they are show-specific spellings.

## Caption Style Presets

Caption look and placement should follow the chosen visual preset, not a separate font menu the creator has to assemble by hand.

Style choices should start from the preset path in `docs/preset-style-picker.md` Controls and brand emphasis from `docs/show-brand-kit-setup.md` Brand Inputs. Each style should preview on the current episode's real caption lines.

| Style choice | Source spec | Relevant section |
| --- | --- | --- |
| caption presence and pacing feel | `docs/preset-style-picker.md` | Controls |
| brand emphasis and readability guardrails | `docs/show-brand-kit-setup.md` | Brand Inputs, Guardrails |
| placement and overlap checks | `docs/layout-safe-areas.md` | Safe Area Types, Checks |
| contrast, size, and motion readability | `docs/accessibility-readability-checks.md` | Checks, Creator Controls |
| template reuse | `docs/show-template-adaptation.md` | Template Contents |

Offer ready-to-use looks with plain-language steps:

- size: compact, standard, large
- placement zone: lower third, lower center, top safe band
- emphasis for names, products, and show terms
- motion: static lines, word-by-word reveal, or smooth fade

Use simple controls: choose a style that fits the preset, adjust size and placement with named steps, turn motion up or down, and keep one reset back to the preset default. Avoid keyframes, easing curves, font files, timecode offsets, or per-frame animation editing in this path.

Flag caption style only when it affects the finished episode:

- ready
- needs review
- conflict with lower-thirds, sponsor marks, or speaker faces

These states should surface in caption review and in `docs/publish-checklist.md` captions reviewed when placement or readability would affect export.

## Speaker Awareness

The product should keep audio and caption fixes tied to speaker buckets:

- show which speaker has the issue
- let creators preview only that speaker's track when useful
- preserve host and guest naming from ingest and social context
- avoid applying one guest's spelling corrections to another guest unless confirmed

When a creator trusts the words but not who is attached to them, speaker-label fixes should route to `docs/speaker-attribution-review.md` instead of being treated like a wording or style correction.

## Review Flow

The default review path should group issues by likely publishing impact:

- must fix before export
- worth reviewing
- informational

Creators should be able to jump from an issue to the affected moment, play the surrounding context, and mark it fixed or ignored.

Speaker-name mismatches, unlabeled exchanges, and off-camera voice confusion should open `docs/speaker-attribution-review.md` when the caption problem is really about who is speaking rather than how the text looks.

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that makes speech clarity and caption accuracy easier to review before export. Close work that exposes audio engineering internals, treats captions as a raw transcript editor, or ignores speaker buckets and long-form review needs.
